# Minesweeper-Python-
A minesweeper game I created using Python as part of the HyperionDev/Imperial College London Data Science bootcamp. 

The programme uses two-dimensional lists and nested loops to recreate popular tabletop game Minesweeper. The user enters a grid containing '#' symbols to represent positions with mines and the '-' symbol to represent mine-free spots. 

The programme then returns a grid where each '-' is replaced by a digit that indicates the number of mines immediately adjacent (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) to the spot.
